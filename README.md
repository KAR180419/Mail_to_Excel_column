# Mail_to_Excel_column
Python code for mailing to a column of emails.
I have an excel sheet which has Name column and Email Column.
As per the code, I have read this excel sheet into the python program and stored the email column for bcc. This can be done for cc as well.
The concept is same as to send [mail to multiple](https://github.com/KAR180419/Multi_Email_Automation) people.
